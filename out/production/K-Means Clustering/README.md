# K-Means Clustering Algorithm - Java ( JavaFX )
A project for my course Programming III in FAMNIT.

K-means clustering is one of the basic algorithms for clustering. In this project you will solve a clustering algorithm using GPS coordinates of locations in Europe. Each location includes a capacity. The locations and capacities are garbage collection facilities. Their capacity is the annual amount of waste accumulated in tonnes. The result of the k-means clustering will be a sub-optimal placement of k facilities that process the accumulated waste. The optimization minimizes the distance between accumulation sites and processing plants. The problem must be generalized to provide such that it solves an arbitrary amount of facilities.
